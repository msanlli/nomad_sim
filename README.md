# NomadSim

You accomplished your dreams and worked as a pilot for a major airline, but after a couple years you realised that the comercial aviation wasn't for you, you needed an adventure.

You decided to quit your job and start a company froms scratch, you started to pull some strings and one friend of yours told you about a logistic shortage in Iceland because of the difficult terrain and the lack of roads, so you decided to start a company that would help the locals to transport goods quick and safely.
